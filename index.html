        <h5>Scheduler</h5>
        <p>As a scheduler I created calendars for assigned clients each month. I ensured that all shifts were staffed for all of my clients calendars and ensured that their needs were met. Each week I would track the hours used for each client and service. Additionaly I ran a monthly meeting with the staff to ensure quality of care and took an on call phone for emergencies after hours.</p>
